# Task 7: SVM 
## Objective: 
Use SVMs for linear and non-linear classification.
## Tools:
- Sci-Kit Learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
## Steps Followed:
1. Loaded Breast Cancer dataset and did necessary preprocessing
2. Fitted a SVM Model using Linear and RBF Kernel
3. Found best parameters with hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search
4. Evaluated the performance using cross validation
5. Reduced dimensionality of the data to 2D using PCA for decision boundary visualization
6. Visualized the decision boundary using SVM Model fitted on reuced dataset with Linear and rbf kernels.
